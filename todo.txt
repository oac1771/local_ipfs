server

cli
    - create config object that read/writes to file at $HOME
        - should contain encryption key
        - should contain ipfs hashes and maybe descyptions?

    - create command that reads file, encrypts, sends bytes to server to add to ipfs
    - create command that gets from ipfs, decrypts, and prints to std
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry


docker compose to run:
- ipfs container
- rpc to interact with grafana/prometheus
- grafana
- prometheus

server
    - make ipfs module not actually call ipfs in integration tests
        - might need to wrap reqwest::Client and use mock_all?
    - might need to start a process to handle gossip messages
        - inner struct that can be used in ipfs api and gossip handler 
    - update state once pin rm has been called 
        - should gossip this to other nodes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

refactor:
    - create a response type channel for when state and network exit out of their loop {select!{}} so
        you can join!{} on those handles and make sure the cleanup happens

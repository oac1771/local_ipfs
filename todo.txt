server
    - check states in test
    - update metrics to get pinned hashes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

refactor:
    - state_client could be dht table from kadmelia so each node can be stateless

server
    - create integration tests
        - bootstrap

    - update state once pin rm has been called 
        - should gossip this to other nodes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

refactor:
    - create a response type channel for when state and network exit out of their loop {select!{}} so
        you can join!{} on those handles and make sure the cleanup happens

server
    - create bootnode server
        - fails when boot-node flag is used. I bet its because sender is dropped? if no ipfs client
    - update state once pin rm has been called 
        - should gossip this to other nodes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

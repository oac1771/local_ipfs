server
    - use tokio::time::timeout instead of select!{} using duration
    - add Identify protocol with kad
        - https://docs.rs/libp2p-kad/latest/libp2p_kad/
    - update state once pin rm has been called 
        - should gossip this to other nodes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

refactor:
    - create a response type channel for when state and network exit out of their loop {select!{}} so
        you can join!{} on those handles and make sure the cleanup happens

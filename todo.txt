server
    - update statecommand to also take oneshot to make sure it was received correctly, similar to bruja...
    - endpoint for grafana to show what hashes are being pinned
        - probably need to add a state service that is running in backgroound which ipfs and metrics can read and write from using channels 
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry


docker compose to run:
- ipfs container
- rpc to interact with grafana/prometheus/ipfs node
- grafana
- prometheus

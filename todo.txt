server

    - test for ipfs add_file gossip message
        - need client to simute cli command in serverrunner
        - make buildrespone() in mock take url and decide correct response body
            - could make mockrequest client be hashmap that maps url to payload
            - buildresponse a struct method 

    - network start could be outside of starting server in different process since those two things should not be linked
        - might need to start a process to handle gossip messages
            - inner struct that can be used in ipfs api and gossip handler 

    - update state once pin rm has been called 
        - should gossip this to other nodes
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
        - should gossip pinning requests and remove pinning requests across network
        - will need save gossiped hash in state

cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry

refactor:
    - state_client could be dht table from kadmelia so each node can be stateless
    - create a response type channel for when state and network exit out of their loop {select!{}} so
        you can join!{} on those handles and make sure the cleanup happens

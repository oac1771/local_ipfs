server
    - add metrics endpoint for prometheus using crate, might have to feature gate it:
        - https://crates.io/crates/prometheus
            - ask chatgpt to show you example of configuring grpc and prometheus server

    - or push to pushgateway instead
        - probably easier 
    - endpoint for grafana to show what hashes are being pinned
    - look into gossiping so changes can propogate over the network 
cli
    - start/stop docker compose 
        - would need server image to be in remote public registry


docker compose to run:
- ipfs container
- rpc to interact with grafana/prometheus/ipfs node
- grafana
- prometheus
